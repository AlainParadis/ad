Starting soon, our talented third-year Graphic Design students at Algonquin College will begin applying to join creative teams across Canada’s National Capital Region for their **2026 Fieldwork placements**.

This is one of the most exciting times of the year for both our students and our industry partners. From **March 10 to April 17, 2026**, students will immerse themselves in the professional world of graphic design—working a minimum of **180 hours over six weeks**,  gaining hands-on experience that prepares them for the next stage of their careers.

### What Makes Fieldwork Special

Our **Fieldwork program** is more than just an internship. It’s a carefully designed introduction to the professional practice of graphic design, offering students:

<ul>
	<li>Mentorship & collaboration — Students work alongside experienced designers and become part of your team.</li>
	<li>Real-world experience — They follow the rhythm of a professional workplace, whether in-person or remote.</li>
	<li>Meaningful contribution — Students bring fresh energy, creativity, and problem-solving skills to your projects.</li>
</ul>

### Why Your Participation Matters

Our industry thrives when emerging designers are given the chance to learn and grow. By hosting a student, you’re helping shape the next generation of creative talent—while gaining a motivated team member eager to contribute.

We ask our employer partners to:

<ul>
	<li>Conduct a thoughtful interview process to select the right student.</li>
	<li>Offer supervision and mentorship in a safe, productive environment.</li>
	<li>Provide feedback on the student’s performance through a short end-of-placement report.</li>
</ul>

Whether you offer a salaried position or a volunteer placement, your support helps build a stronger future for design in the National Capital Region.

### Ready to Get Involved?

If you’re an employer interested in hosting a student, or if you have questions about the process, reach out to **Alain Paradis** at [paradia@algonquincollege.com](mailto:paradia@algonquincollege.com).

Together, let’s make this year’s Fieldwork season an unforgettable one, for our students, for your team, and for the future of design.
