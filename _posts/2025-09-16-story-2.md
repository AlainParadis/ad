Mark your calendars! ðŸŽ‰

Our **2026 Graphic Design Grad Show** is happening **Thursday, April 16, 2026, from 5:00â€“9:00 PM**. This student-organized event is the perfect way to celebrate three years of hard work, creativity, and growth.

Join us to:

* See the **best design work** from this yearâ€™s graduating class

This is more than a showcase, itâ€™s a networking event, a celebration, and a send-off all rolled into one. Donâ€™t miss it!
